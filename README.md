For this project, I use VueJS as the front end framwork and jest for unit
testing.

1. To run the program, open console and go to the current folder and run the
    command "npm run serve". Once that's done running you should see 2 URLs that
    looks similar to this:

      App running at:
      - Local:   http://localhost:8082/
      - Network: http://192.168.1.191:8082/
    Run either of them on a browser and you should be able to see the page.

2. To run the test type the command "npm run test:unit". It will go through
    all the test cases that's stored under the "tests/unit" folder.
    At the end, it will show how many test cases have passed and failed.
